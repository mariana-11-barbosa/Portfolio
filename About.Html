                <p id="About-SubTitle">Global Designer</p>
                <p id="About-Description">I'm Mariana, a Global Design student at IADE.
                    <br>I found my passion for design with David's Carson Masterclass, which opened my eyes to the profound impact design can have on the world.
                    From that moment, I realized design isn t just about aesthetics, it s a powerful way to communicate and express who we are.
                    <br>One of the biggest challenges I've faced as a designer was creating my CV and my Portfolio.
                    With so many interests and passions, it can be hard to sum up who I am in just a few pages or images! But one thing I ve always been certain about is my love for design.
                    In addition to design, I m deeply passionate about photography, Legos, crochet, sports, food, nature, and animals; each of these interests plays an important role in my daily life and creative process.
                    <br>I love finding beauty in the small things, and this shows up in everything I do, including how I organize my space. Take my bedroom, for example, its a messy and simple white room with white furniture, filled with little details of color and personal touches everywhere you look.
                    I think this reflects my design philosophy; it s the little details that make all the difference.</p>
